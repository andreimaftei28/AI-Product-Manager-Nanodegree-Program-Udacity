# Project Overview

### In the previous project, you created the instructions needed to build a labeled dataset that distinguishes between healthy and pneumonia x-ray images. 
### This dataset would eventually be used to build a product that helps doctors quickly identify cases of pneumonia in children. 
### Remember that the goals of this product are to:

## help flag serious cases,
## quickly identify healthy cases,
## and, generally, act as a diagnostic aid for doctors.

### In this project, we are going to take the next step and build the classification model that would serve as the backbone of this product. 
### (Don't worry, there's no coding involved!) For this task, we will use Google AutoML, an automated machine learning tool that will allow us to build the model and host it in the cloud. 
### In order to appreciate how training data impact models, we will build models with 4 variants of the dataset. This project is designed to test your ability to

## build a model using Google's AutoML Vision platform, and
## understand how properties of data impact performance of models.
